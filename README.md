# Self-Assessment

## Functionality
 - When it comes to functionality, at this moment of time I would give myself a 3, because I have done everything except the
  cracking method.

## Object Oriented Programming
  - I would give myself a 4 when it come's tp this. I have used both inheritance and modules in my project to the best of my ability.

## Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
  - When it comes to this, I would like to give myself a 4, but i'm pretty sure I probably get a 3 because even though I reviewed
   my code multiple times, there might be a syntax error that I did not see or maybe a naming convention that was bad.

## Test Driven Development
  - I would give myself a 3 as well in my opinion, because I feel like I probably could have used more mocks and stubs in other
   places, but because i'm still trying to learn it, I don't fully comprehend it.

## Version Control
  - I believe I also got a 4 on version control because I have passed 40 commits and 9 pull request. Not only that each commit
   and pull request have a description that explaining exactly what they do or change, As well as, a commit only having small pieces
   of code while the pull request is more bulky when it comes to code.
